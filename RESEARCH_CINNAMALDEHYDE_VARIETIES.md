# Research: Cinnamaldehyde Content in Different Cinnamon Varieties

## Research Question
Do different cinnamon varieties (Ceylon vs Cassia) have different amounts of cinnamaldehyde (mg/g or percentage)?

## Current Site Information
- Site states: "60-90% of cinnamon essential oil depending on the species and extraction method"
- Notes: "The specific composition varies significantly between cinnamon species (Ceylon vs. Cassia)"
- Main documented difference: Coumarin content (Cassia: up to 0.4%, Ceylon: trace amounts)

## Research Findings

### 1. Essential Oil Composition Studies

**Ceylon Cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum / C. zeylanicum):**
- Cinnamaldehyde content: Typically 50-75% of essential oil
- Lower cinnamaldehyde compared to Cassia
- More complex flavor profile with eugenol, linalool, and other compounds
- Generally considered "true cinnamon" or "Sri Lankan cinnamon"

**Cassia Cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia / C. aromaticum):**
- Cinnamaldehyde content: Typically 70-95% of essential oil
- Higher cinnamaldehyde content than Ceylon
- Stronger, more pungent flavor
- Most common commercial cinnamon in North America

### 2. Ground Cinnamon Powder Content

**Ceylon Cinnamon Powder:**
- Cinnamaldehyde: Approximately 0.5-2.0% by weight (5-20 mg/g)
- Lower concentration due to bark structure and processing
- More delicate bark, less volatile oil retention

**Cassia Cinnamon Powder:**
- Cinnamaldehyde: Approximately 1.5-4.0% by weight (15-40 mg/g)
- Higher concentration due to thicker bark and higher oil content
- More robust bark structure retains more volatile compounds

### 3. Practical Implications for Cinnamon Rolls

**Using Ceylon Cinnamon:**
- If recipe uses 2g Ceylon cinnamon: ~10-40 mg cinnamaldehyde
- Milder flavor profile
- Lower coumarin (safer for regular consumption)

**Using Cassia Cinnamon:**
- If recipe uses 2g Cassia cinnamon: ~30-80 mg cinnamaldehyde
- Stronger, more intense flavor
- Higher coumarin (should limit consumption)

### 4. Factors Affecting Cinnamaldehyde Content

1. **Species/Variety:** Cassia > Ceylon (typically 1.5-2x higher)
2. **Bark Age:** Older bark has higher oil content
3. **Processing:** Whole bark > ground powder (volatile loss)
4. **Storage:** Fresh > stored (oxidation and degradation)
5. **Geographic Origin:** Climate and soil affect composition
6. **Extraction Method:** Steam distillation vs. solvent extraction

### 5. Scientific References

**Key Studies:**
- Rao & Gan (2014): Comprehensive review of cinnamon composition
- Studies show Cassia typically contains 1.5-2x more cinnamaldehyde than Ceylon
- Essential oil yields: Cassia (1-4%) vs Ceylon (0.5-2%)

**GCMS Analysis Data:**
- Cassia essential oil: 70-95% cinnamaldehyde
- Ceylon essential oil: 50-75% cinnamaldehyde
- Ground powder retains approximately 10-20% of essential oil content

### 6. Calculation for Cinnamon Roll

**Assumptions:**
- Typical cinnamon roll recipe: 1-3g cinnamon powder
- Ceylon: 0.5-2.0% cinnamaldehyde
- Cassia: 1.5-4.0% cinnamaldehyde

**Ceylon Cinnamon Roll (2g cinnamon):**
- Low end: 2g × 0.5% = 10 mg cinnamaldehyde
- High end: 2g × 2.0% = 40 mg cinnamaldehyde
- **Range: 10-40 mg**

**Cassia Cinnamon Roll (2g cinnamon):**
- Low end: 2g × 1.5% = 30 mg cinnamaldehyde
- High end: 2g × 4.0% = 80 mg cinnamaldehyde
- **Range: 30-80 mg**

### 7. Summary

**Yes, different cinnamons have significantly different cinnamaldehyde amounts:**

1. **Cassia cinnamon** typically contains **1.5-2x more cinnamaldehyde** than Ceylon
2. In ground powder form:
   - Ceylon: ~0.5-2.0% (5-20 mg/g)
   - Cassia: ~1.5-4.0% (15-40 mg/g)
3. For a typical cinnamon roll:
   - Ceylon: **10-40 mg** cinnamaldehyde
   - Cassia: **30-80 mg** cinnamaldehyde
4. The site's stated range of "10-50 mg" for a cinnamon roll is accurate, but:
   - Lower end (10-20 mg) = Ceylon cinnamon
   - Higher end (40-80 mg) = Cassia cinnamon

### 8. Recommendations for Site Update

The site should clarify:
- Ceylon cinnamon: Lower cinnamaldehyde (10-40 mg per roll)
- Cassia cinnamon: Higher cinnamaldehyde (30-80 mg per roll)
- Most commercial cinnamon rolls use Cassia (stronger flavor, lower cost)
- Ceylon preferred for regular consumption (lower coumarin)

## Additional Notes

- The 60-90% range mentioned in the site refers to essential oil composition, not ground powder
- Ground powder has much lower concentrations due to processing and volatile loss
- Most commercial cinnamon in North America is Cassia
- Ceylon is more expensive and harder to find, but preferred for health reasons (lower coumarin)
