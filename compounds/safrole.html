                <h3>Function in Human Physiology</h3>
                
                <h4>Historical Use and Regulatory Status</h4>
                <p>
                    Safrole was historically used as a flavoring agent, particularly in root beer and sassafras 
                    tea. However, safrole has been identified as a potential carcinogen and is now restricted or 
                    banned in many countries:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>FDA has banned safrole as a food additive due to carcinogenicity concerns</li>
                    <li>Classified as a Group 2B carcinogen (possibly carcinogenic to humans) by IARC</li>
                    <li>Metabolites of safrole can form DNA adducts</li>
                    <li>Still found naturally in small amounts in some spices (nutmeg, mace, cinnamon)</li>
                    <li>Regulatory limits exist on safrole content in foods</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Important:</strong> While safrole is naturally present in some spices at low levels, 
                    it is not approved for use as a food additive, and products containing significant amounts 
                    of safrole are restricted. This compound is included in Terpedia for educational purposes 
                    and to highlight the importance of safety evaluation in functional flavor compounds.
                </p>

                <h4>Metabolism and Toxicity</h4>
                <p>
                    Safrole undergoes metabolic activation in the liver:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes to 1'-hydroxysafrole</li>
                    <li>Further metabolism produces reactive intermediates</li>
                    <li>These metabolites can form DNA adducts, potentially leading to carcinogenicity</li>
                    <li>Metabolism is dose-dependent, with higher doses producing more reactive metabolites</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
                <p>
                    Safrole occurs naturally in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sassafras (high concentrations - up to 80% of essential oil)</li>
                    <li>Nutmeg and mace (trace amounts)</li>
                    <li>Some cinnamon varieties (trace amounts)</li>
                    <li>Black pepper (trace amounts)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The natural occurrence of safrole in spices at low levels is generally considered acceptable, 
                    but products with high safrole content are restricted.
                </p>

                <h3>Mechanisms of Action</h3>
                <p>
                    Safrole's biological effects (and toxicity) are mediated through:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Metabolic Activation:</strong> Conversion to reactive metabolites by cytochrome P450 enzymes</li>
                    <li><strong>DNA Adduct Formation:</strong> Reactive metabolites can bind to DNA, potentially causing mutations</li>
                    <li><strong>Enzyme Inhibition:</strong> May inhibit various enzymes</li>
                    <li><strong>Carcinogenic Potential:</strong> DNA adducts may contribute to carcinogenicity</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Metabolism and Bioavailability</h3>
                <p>
                    After ingestion, safrole undergoes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rapid absorption from the gastrointestinal tract</li>
                    <li>Extensive metabolism in the liver via cytochrome P450 enzymes (primarily CYP2E1)</li>
                    <li>Primary metabolite: 1'-hydroxysafrole</li>
                    <li>Further metabolism produces reactive intermediates</li>
                    <li>Excretion primarily in urine as conjugated metabolites</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The metabolic activation of safrole is a key factor in its toxicity, with reactive metabolites 
                    potentially causing DNA damage.

                    <li>Should not be used as a flavoring agent</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This compound is included in Terpedia to demonstrate the importance of safety evaluation 
                    in functional flavor compounds and to highlight that not all naturally occurring compounds 
                    are safe for use as food additives, even if they have biological activities.
