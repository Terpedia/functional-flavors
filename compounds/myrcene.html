                <h3>Function in Human Physiology</h3>
                
                <h4>Sedative and Muscle Relaxant Effects</h4>
                <p>
                    Myrcene is one of the most abundant terpenes in cannabis and is known for its sedative and 
                    muscle relaxant properties. Research demonstrates that myrcene can produce sedative effects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enhances sedative effects of other compounds</li>
                    <li>Muscle relaxant properties</li>
                    <li>May help with sleep and relaxation</li>
                    <li>Commonly found in hops, which are used in beer and traditional sleep remedies</li>
                    <li>May enhance effects of other sedative compounds</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Studies demonstrate that myrcene can enhance the sedative effects of barbiturates and other 
                    sedative compounds, suggesting it may have synergistic effects (do Vale et al., 2002). This 
                    property has been recognized in traditional medicine, where hops (rich in myrcene) have been 
                    used for their sedative effects.
                </p>

                <h4>Anti-inflammatory Activity</h4>
                <p>
                    Myrcene exhibits significant anti-inflammatory properties:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inhibits production of pro-inflammatory cytokines</li>
                    <li>Suppresses cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme activity</li>
                    <li>Modulates inflammatory signaling pathways</li>
                    <li>Reduces expression of inflammatory mediators</li>
                    <li>May help alleviate symptoms of inflammatory conditions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Research demonstrates that myrcene can reduce inflammation in various model systems, including 
                    models of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions (Lorenzetti et al., 1991).
                </p>

                <h4>Analgesic Properties</h4>
                <p>
                    Myrcene demonstrates pain-relieving effects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduces pain perception in animal models</li>
                    <li>May enhance effects of other analgesics</li>
                    <li>Anti-inflammatory effects contribute to pain relief</li>
                    <li>Used in traditional medicine for pain management</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Studies demonstrate that myrcene can reduce pain in various models, with effects comparable 
                    to some standard analgesics (Lorenzetti et al., 1991).
                </p>

                <h4>Antimicrobial Activity</h4>
                <p>
                    Myrcene exhibits antimicrobial properties:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Effective against various bacteria</li>
                    <li>Antifungal activity</li>
                    <li>Mechanism involves disruption of cell membranes</li>
                    <li>Used in natural preservatives</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Enhanced Bioavailability</h4>
                <p>
                    One of myrcene's most interesting properties is its ability to enhance the bioavailability 
                    of other compounds:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increases permeability of cell membranes</li>
                    <li>May enhance absorption of other compounds</li>
                    <li>In cannabis, myrcene is thought to enhance cannabinoid effects</li>
                    <li>This property may contribute to synergistic effects in complex mixtures</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This enhancement of bioavailability is particularly relevant in the context of functional 
                    flavors, where myrcene may help other compounds reach their targets more effectively.

                <h3>Mechanisms of Action</h3>
                <p>
                    Myrcene's biological effects are mediated through:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Membrane Effects:</strong> Enhances membrane permeability, potentially affecting 
                        absorption of other compounds</li>
                    <li><strong>Enzyme Inhibition:</strong> Inhibits various enzymes involved in inflammation</li>
                    <li><strong>Receptor Interactions:</strong> May interact with various receptors</li>
                    <li><strong>Gene Expression:</strong> Modulates transcription of genes involved in inflammation</li>
                    <li><strong>Synergistic Effects:</strong> Enhances effects of other compounds through 
                        bioavailability enhancement</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Metabolism and Bioavailability</h3>
                <p>
                    After ingestion, myrcene undergoes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Absorption from the gastrointestinal tract</li>
                    <li>Metabolism primarily in the liver via cytochrome P450 enzymes</li>
                    <li>Primary metabolites include myrcenol and other oxidized products</li>
                    <li>Some metabolites may have biological activities</li>
                    <li>Excretion primarily in urine as conjugated metabolites</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Myrcene's ability to enhance membrane permeability may affect its own bioavailability and that 
                    of co-administered compounds.
                </p>

                <h3>Safety and Considerations</h3>
                <p>
                    Myrcene is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used in foods:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Low toxicity when consumed in typical food amounts</li>
                    <li>Generally well-tolerated</li>
                    <li>Commonly found in hops, bay leaves, and other plants</li>
                    <li>Used extensively in food and beverages</li>
                    <li>One of the most common terpenes in the human diet</li>
                </ul>
